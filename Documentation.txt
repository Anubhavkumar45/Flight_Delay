Task:
Build a binary classification model for predicting arrival delays > 15minutes without using departure delay as an input feature.

Dataset:
US Dept. of Transportation on-time performance data for non-stop domestic flights

- Link: https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time
- Data range: [Geography = All of America], [Year-Month = 2019 March to 2020 Feb]

Approach:
1) Load data
2) Wrangle data: Check for class imbalances and handle it by sampling from the dataset
3) Wrangle data: Check for sparse columns to remove them
4) Wrangle data: Check for columns with a few missing values to impute with zero, mean or median
5) Wrangle data: Encode categorical values to numerical values
6) Exploratory analyss: Infer distribution of data using histograms
7) Exploratory analyss: Use measures of central tendency and IQR to understand data at various positions
8) Variable interdependence: Infer multicollinearity of data through correlation matrix
9) Feature selection: Remove redundant variables (i.e. columns that refer to the same thing e.g. ID)
10) Feature engineering: Remove highly collinear variables (i.e. correlation > 0.8)
11) Feature engineering: Reduce data dimension to the variables that most explain variation in target variable
12) Modeling building: Random forest is chosen for machine learning modeling
13) Machine learning process:
    (a) Train/test data: Split data for training and testing
    (b) Model creation: Create models in a grid search for a combination of parameters
    (c) Model selection: Use 5-fold cross validation to evaluate model performance and select the best one
    (c) Final Model training: Use parameters of the best model from above to train on entire train set
    (d) Final Model evaluation: Use 5-fold cross validation for average error on 5 folds of training data
    (e) Final Model performance evaluation: Use confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, ROC to evaluate performance
